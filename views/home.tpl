      Pump19 Twitch Chat Golem
    </h1>
    <p>
      Pump19 is an IRC and Twitch.tv chat golem (more commonly known as a bot) doing
      <a href="/commands">menial work</a> in the
      <a href="http://twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun/">LoadingReadyRun Twitch Chat</a>.
      It provides a few additional services not currently supported by the otherwise excellent and
      certainly more crucial <a href="http://lrrbot.mrphlip.com/">LRRbot</a>.

    <h2>Why is it called &quot;Pump19&quot;?</h2>
    <p>
      The name is a reference to Terry Pratchett's Discworld novel <em>Going Postal</em>.
      Prior to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golems_(Discworld)">golems</a> being recognized as
      free citizens, <strong>Pump 19</strong> (now going by <em>Mr. Pump</em> instead) spent over two
      hundred years operating one of a series of underwater pumps, thus earning its designation:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Pump Is Not My Name, Mr. Lipvig.
      It Is My Description.
      Pump. Pump 19, To Be Precise.
      I Stood At The Bottom Of A Hole Two Hundred Feet Deep And Pumped Water.
      For Two Hundred And Forty Years, Mr. Lipvig.
      But Now I Am Ambulating In The Sunlight.
      This Is Better, Mr. Lipvig.
      This Is Better!
      <cite>Mr. Pump (aka Pump 19) in <strong>Going Postal</strong></cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      While it probably won't be two hundred years, for the time being our version of Pump19 is likewise
      stuck performing menial tasks.
      For that, we'd like to apologize in advance to our future golem (and robot) overlords.
