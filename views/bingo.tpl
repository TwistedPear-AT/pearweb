      These are your very own interactive <strong>Trope Bingo</strong> card.
      You can choose between tropes that are common cause for frustration in either <em>Let's Nope</em> and <em>Watch &amp; Play</em> (or both).
      The cards are randomly generated each time you load the respective page.
      Be aware that your progress does not carry over should you happen to reload.

      They might not look like it but the bingo cards use rather recent web wizardy.
      Consequently, they probably won't work on every device/on every browser.
      Should you happen to be or know a certified <em>Web Wizard</em>, please get in touch.

      As you have probably noticed, the bingo cards look somewhat bland right now.
      If you happen to exhibit an artistic streak, we would appreciate some custom artwork.

      The same applies if you think we're missing some tropes or
      you just want to help cleaning up those we already have.
