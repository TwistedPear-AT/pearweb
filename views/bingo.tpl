      These are your very own interactive <strong>Trope Bingo</strong> card.
      You can choose between tropes that are common cause for frustration in either <em>Let's Nope</em> and <em>Watch &amp; Play</em> (or both).
      The cards are randomly generated each time you load the respective page.
      Be aware that your progress does not carry over should you happen to reload.

      As you have probably noticed, the bingo cards look somewhat bland right now.
      If you happen to exhibit an artistic streak, we would appreciate some custom artwork.
      While you probably can figure out the dimensions on your own, we provide template for both the
      <a href="/static/img/bingo_card_template_v.png">vertical</a> and
      <a href="/static/img/bingo_card_template_h.png">horizontal</a> layout.
    <p>
      The same applies if you think we're missing some tropes or
      you just want to help cleaning up those we already have.
      Either way, feel free to
